# ImageProcessing-OpenCV

Image processing mini-projects I'm working on using OpenCV.


# Projects:

### Lane Line Tracking
Detect and track the lane lines on a highway. Also performed on video.

### Image Stitching
Feature matching method comparisons using ORB keypoints/descriptors:

Stitching two images from my living room using SIFT.

### Ski Jump Trajectory Visualization
Idea for app that could estimate trajectory for going off a ski jump by having user take a picture of the jump and select 3 points, 1) starting location 2) bottom of jump 3) top of jump. Users could build a jump and visually determine if the jump is big enough/how high to drop from/if they'll clear the landing by taking a picture with their phone. Best performance when jump viewed directly from the side, can be viewed from either side. 

#### X Games Jump:

### CLAHE Image Processing
[CLAHE](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d5/daf/tutorial_py_histogram_equalization.html) enhancement for improved visibility under flat light conditions:
